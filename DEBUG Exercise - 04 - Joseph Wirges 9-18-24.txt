**new corrected pseudocode**
-------------------------

// This pseudocode segment is intended to compute and display
// the cost of home ownership for any number of users
// The program ends when a user enters 0 for the mortgage payment
start
	Declarations
		num mortgagePayment
      		num utilities
      		num taxes
      		num upkeep
      		num total
	startup()
	while true do // Loop until user enters 0 for mortgage payment
		mainLoop()
	endwhile
stop





changes:
---------------------------

"while mortgagePayment not equal to 0"    I just shortened it to "while true" and so we don't need "endwhile"

We don't need the "startup statement" at the end so i removed
