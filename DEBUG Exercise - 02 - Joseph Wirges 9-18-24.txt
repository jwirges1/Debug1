DEBUG Exercise - 02


Question: You have been tasked with reviewing and updating this program. What steps would you take to identify any issues in the code?
Your Response:  Test to make sure that the pseudocode would actually create the intended output.

Question: What actions could the developer have taken to minimize the number of errors?
Your Response:  recheck the code afterwards.   Test the code to see if the output is correct.  Proofread for mistakes

// This pseudocode is intended to display employee net pay values.
// All employees have a standard $45 deduction from their checks.
// If an employee does not earn enough to cover the deduction
// an error message is displayed.

start
	Declarations
		string name
		num hours
		num rate
		const DEDUCTION = 45.0 # Declare a constant deduction amount
		num grossPay
		num netPay
	output "Enter first name or ", EOFNAME, " to quit"
	input name
	if (name != EOFNAME)
		output "Enter hours worked for ", name
		input hours
		output "Enter hourly rate for ", name
		input rate
		grossPay = hours * rate
		# Calculate net pay by subtracting the deduction from gross pay
		if (grossPay >= DEDUCTION)
			netPay = grossPay - DEDUCTION;
			output "Net pay for ", name, " is $", formatFloat(netPay)
		else
			If deductions exceed earnings, display an error message
				output "Deductions not covered. Net is $0."

			else
	Display end of job message when user quits
	output("End of job")
stop




changes:
made the deduction = 4 a constant so that it remains the same throughout

i put parenthesis around the name !=EOFNAME

when ZZZ is entered it will display an end of job message

made it so net pay would be calculated by subtracting deduction from gross pay and also allowed it to show a warning

changed the format of how the netpay is displayed
