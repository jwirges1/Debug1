Question: You have been tasked with reviewing and updating this program. What steps would you take to identify any issues in the code?
Your Response:  Test to make sure that the pseudocode would actually create the intended output.

Question: What actions could the developer have taken to minimize the number of errors?
Your Response:  recheck the code afterwards.   Test the code to see if the output is correct.  Proofread for mistakes





ISN'T THIS THE SAME AS QUESTION 1?????

// This pseudocode is intended to determine whether students have
// passed or failed a course; student needs to average 60 or
// more on two tests.
 
start
	Declarations
		num firstTest = 0
		num secondTest = 0
		num average = 0.0
		const int PASSING_THRESHOLD = 60
	output "Enter first score or 'q' to quit: "
	while (firstTest != 0) and (secondTest == 0)
		input "Enter first score: "
		if the input is not a number then exit program with error message
		else set firstTest equal to that value
		output "Enter second score: "
		input secondTest
		average = (firstTest + secondTest) / 2.0
		output "Average is ", average
		if average >= PASSING_THRESHOLD then
			output "Pass"
		else
			output "Fail"
		endif
	endwhile
stop



I initialized the num firstTest, secondTest etc as they didn't have a definition

I wanted to use a constant instead of a magic number as magic number is vague

I added "if the input is not a number then exit program with error message" so the validation would also validate that it is an actual number

"while firstTest not equal to 0" would loop infinitely so you wouldn't be able to enter another score unless you restarted everything over each time

The average in the original equation would not produce the correct average, it would only divide test 2 by 2 and add test 1 mathematically so I made it so the sum of test1 and test2 are both added and then that number divided by 2
